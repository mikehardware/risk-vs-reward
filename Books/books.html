    <h2><em>Mike Hardware, P.I. The Case of the Vexatious Executive</em></h2>
    <h4>(Mystery Series)</h4>
    <p>Shy, polite, and chronically insecure, Mike Hardware decides to reinvent himself as a private detective after being unceremoniously fired from his job. Never mind that he suffers from prosopagnosia — face blindness — which makes identifying suspects a bit... tricky.</p>
    <p>Fortunately, Mike isn’t going it alone. He’s joined by Kaye Sparks, his sharply observant assistant with a knack for meticulous note-taking, and Mr. Diogi, Mike’s demanding partner with a nose for clues.</p>
    <p>Their first case? Solve the murder of Mike’s former boss’s ex-husband. Things get even more complicated when the boss herself, the formidable Mrs. Perriman, becomes the prime suspect — and demands that Mike find the real killer, or else.</p>
    <p>It’s a race against time (and one very vexatious executive) as Mike and his team dig through secrets, suspects, and surprises in their first big case.</p>
    <p><em>Coming soon!</em></p>
