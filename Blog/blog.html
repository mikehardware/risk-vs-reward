      <h3>How to Fail at a Gameshow Audition (and eventually pass)</h3>
      <small>Posted June 25, 2025</small>
      <p>Have you ever wondered what happens in a gameshow audition? I can tell you firsthand, it’s not easy to pass and make it onto television. My gameshow obsession started as a kid watching TV in the 1960s, the classic time for gameshows. However, it wasn’t until the early 1980s that the thought occurred to me that I could be a contestant myself.</p>
      <p>The jumpstart was the success of a contestant on <em>Tic Tac Dough</em>- Thom McKee won 43 consecutive games, winning $312,700 in cash and prizes in 1980. Watching it unfold on TV as a broke college student, my thoughts were that’s a huge amount of winnings, and I could do that! Eventually, I got my chance. The show held auditions near me, so I went.</p> 
      <p>I had no idea what to expect, so I was completely unprepared. First was a timed written test, no problem. General trivia like on the show. Aced it. The non-passers had to leave the auditorium. Then the crew announced they were going to chat with the passers. I thought, “No problem. I can watch other folks and see how they do, maybe figure out what to say.” Guess who was the very first person selected to stand up! My responses were awful – short, shy, awkward. Not good TV material. I had to wait around while everyone else did much better, then slink away as the cream of the crop moved on to play a simulated game.</p>
      <p>That was a painful experience, but you can learn from those. It wasn’t to be my last learning opportunity. </p>
      <p>Then came August 16, 1999 – the U.S. debut of <em>Who Wants to be a Millionaire</em>. I was instantly hooked by everything on the show. Big money, trivia, the possibility of being selected randomly from a phone game (bypassing that pesky audition stuff)!  My luck continued. I passed the phone game numerous times but never got the call back to be on the show. Then the process changed – to auditions! Rats.</p>
      <p>This time, I was a little better prepared. ABC had a message board online for fans of the show, and watching folks on that get their callbacks and relate their experiences only fanned the flames on my desire to appear on the show. Passing the trivia test was easy enough. (It was estimated that you need to be correct on 75% of the questions, no problem for me.)</p>
      <p>I tried out repeatedly, and it was the chat part that continued to do me in EVERY SINGLE TIME. I felt I was too quiet and didn’t get to my good stories, so next time I was way more outgoing – and hogged the conversation. I tried to have cute stories, even props. Not what they were looking for apparently. I managed to fail at about ten or more auditions, then I got some good advice.</p>
      <p>While on a business trip to California, I met up with someone from the show message board for dinner. He was a great guy, had been on many gameshows, and clued me in on the secret. The producers want someone like what they put on TV. They don’t want someone who is going to be all “deer in the headlights” when the cameras roll. All that’s really needed is to be yourself (just “bigger”) – so be friendly, confident and relaxed, have fun. Everyone has some story they can use.</p>
      <p>With that, my next audition in New York City went great. When all the people lined up outside the studio before the audition started, an associate producer (AP) came by to instruct everyone to stand near the building instead of blocking the sidewalk. (He yelled, “Up against the wall!”) I immediately put my hands on the building, with my feet back and spread – like the position for getting frisked by police on all the TV shows. That got a laugh from everyone around me, including the AP, so I said, “Oh, you all never heard that phrase before?”)</p>
      <p>Then when we got inside to pick up the test material, one of the crew asked the standard, “How are you?” Instead of the usual, “Fine”, I gave them something they’re probably never heard before in New York City. “I’m finer than frog hair!” That got another laugh out of them.</p>
      <p>I passed the written test as usual and had fun with the interview, it turned out more like a conversation than a question/answer session – then got to do more interview questions on tape (a very good sign). I made the contestant pool at long last!</p>
      <p>Did I mention that they always put more people in the contestant pool than they will actually use? I didn’t make it onto the show, at least not through an audition…. I’ll tell you all about being on Who Wants to be a Millionaire in a later post.</p>
