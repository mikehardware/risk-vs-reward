    <h2>Writing Wrong</h2>
    <small>Posted July 13, 2025</small>
    <p>I don't like to brag, but I'm a multiple-time international award-winning writer. The reason why I don't like to brag? The contest I won was the Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest, which finds the worst possible opening sentence for a hypothetical novel, earning me the dubious honor of being one of the worst writers on the planet. (The contest is named after the author who started one of his novels with "It was a dark and stormy night…" made famous by Snoopy in the Peanuts comic strip.)</p>
    <p>Back in the late 1980s, a friend at work knew I was good at puns and introduced me to the contest. I thoroughly enjoyed coming up with entries, and then in 1990 I got a phone call at work. It was a reporter asking me about winning the Detective category! Short-lived minor local celebrity ensued – an article in the newspaper and interview on a public radio show.</p>
    <p>My <strong>Detective Category</strong> winning entry:  "Mike Hardware was the kind of private eye who didn't know the meaning of the word "fear", a man who could laugh in the face of danger and spit in the eye of death – in short, a moron with suicidal tendencies."</p>
    <p>I followed that up in 1991, winning the <strong>Children's Literature Category</strong> with this:  "Pretty Percy Pig and Jolly Molly Moo-cow enjoyed watching the sunshiny green meadows and cheerful sparkling streams of Pleasant Acres from Farmer Brown's new apple-red truck on their way to the Rainbow Valley Meat Packing Company."</p>
    <p>Those two and some others were included in the Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest books, and they even titled the Detective category section of TWO books after Mike Hardware, P.I. Since they're out of print, here are the rest…</p>
    <p><strong>In Dubious Taste</strong> category (and brace yourself for peak bad taste...): "Diarrhea runs in my family."</p>
    <p><strong>Adventure category:</strong> "Nanook struggled out of the frigid arctic waters onto the ice flow and realized, with the clarity only hindsight gives, that putting the hibachi in his boat had been a mistake – he couldn't have his kayak and heat it, too."</p>
    <p><strong>Detective category:</strong> "Coroner Jones carefully examined the battered corpse, checking for any tiny clue that might help identify the deranged serial killer, and, finding none, cheerfully pushed the body over the cliff and drove home to set up his alibi."</p>
    <p><strong>A Dark and Stormy Night category:</strong> "Sir Bulwer cringed, as much as the shackles allowed, as the royal torturer began his daily litany of verbal abuse - reminding the broker prisoner of his capture in an ill-lit mercantile by smirking, "It was a darkened store, me knight!"</p>
    <p>There's no prize, except for the glory of winning. Of course, a highlight for me was being able to write to my college English department letting them know of my achievement, and to thank them for their help in shaping one of the worst writers in the world.</p>
    <p>So take a stab at the Bulwer-Lytton contest. If you lose, congrats—you're officially not the worst writer in the world. That title's taken. By me. <a href="https://www.bulwer-lytton.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest</a> </p>
    <p>If you don't mind reading writing advice from a total loser like me, I'll be doing a blog post later about how I came to write my mystery novel.</p>
